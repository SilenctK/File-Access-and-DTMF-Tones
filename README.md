# File-Access-and-DTMF-Tones
In this project, I developed a C program that generates a valid 16-bit PCM .wav file containing DTMF tones for a user-specified phone number. I implemented command-line input validation, constructed the correct WAV file header, calculated dual-frequency sine wave samples for each digit, and wrote the formatted audio data to a binary output file.
